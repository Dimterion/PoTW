    The tower where you live is called the Bridge. It is divided into five levels. You are on the second one. One level below you won’t live long, one level above is a border between higher and lower society. Each level has several tiers with resident areas, work stations, stores, food places, etc.
    
    You’ve managed to stay on the current level for a while and haven’t been able to move any higher. Your performance during the Writers Fights is mediocre, but you don’t lose hope to get good.`,
