## <a id="introduction"></a>🔎 Introduction

Poets of Tomorrow’s World is an interactive text adventure game telling a short fictional story.

## <a id="features"></a>📌 Features

- An interactive story made with React
- Various choices and dialogues to pick from to progress through the story and see different outcomes
- The game is built with React, all styling is done with pure CSS and the project is deployed on Vercel
- It may change in the future as I am adjusting its general design and features as I work on it and see fit
- I have also made another text adventure that continues this one's story (it can be seen [here](https://github.com/Dimterion/PoTW-GO/))
- More information on how this game has been made can be found on my Medium blog (starting with [this](https://medium.com/@dimterion/making-an-interactive-text-adventure-game-with-javascript-html-and-css-298b35c8ea96) post)
